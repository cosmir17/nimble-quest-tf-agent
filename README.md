# Nimble Quest AI Bot (PPO)

This repository contains a Reinforcement Learning agent trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to play the game Nimble Quest. The agent learns to navigate and overcome challenges in the game environment.

## Overview

The Nimble Quest AI Bot is built using the Stable Baselines library and trained using the PPO algorithm. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) policy to process game observations and make decisions on actions to take.
